              Establishment and the Directorate of Technical Development and
              Production of the Indian Ordnance Factories with the Defence
              Science Organisation. Subsequently, Defence Research & Development
              Service (DRDS) was constituted in 1979 as a service of Group 'A'
              Officers / Scientists directly under the administrative control of
              Ministry of Defence.

                With a network of 52 laboratories, which are engaged in
                developing defence technologies, covering various fields, like
                aeronautics, armaments, electronics, land combat engineering,
                life sciences, materials, missiles, and naval systems, DRDO is
                India's largest and most diverse research organisation. The
                organisation includes around 5,000 scientists belonging to the
                DRDS and about 25,000 other subordinate scientific, technical
                and supporting personnel

            <h1 class="heading">History Of DRDO</h1>
            <p class="text">
              The DRDO was established in 1958 by amalgamating the Defence
              Science Organisation and some of the technical development
              establishments. A separate Department of Defence Research and
              Development was formed in 1980 which later on administered DRDO
              and its almost 30 laboratories/establishments (there were almost
              52 labs before merging). Most of the time the Defence Research
              Development Organisation was treated as if it was a vendor and the
              Army Headquarters or the Air Headquarters were the customers.
              Because the Army and the Air Force themselves did not have any
              design or construction responsibility, they tended to treat the
              designer or Indian industry at par with their corresponding
              designer in the world market. If they could get a MiG-21 from the
              world market, they wanted a MiG-21 from DRDO.

                India domestically produces only 45% to 50% of defence products
                it uses, and the rest are imported.[14] To become technology
                research and production leader, reduce reliance on the imports
                and increase self-reliance, DRDO Chief called for more
                collaboration with the industry, private sector, research and
                education institutes including IITs and NITs.[14] India's
                military industrial complex has had little success and only
                recently private sector was allowed to enter the defence
                production.[15] To expedite the development cycle of new
                technologies and to better fit the end user requirements, army
                has asked DRDO to take more army staff on deputation to be part
                of DRDO technology development project teams

              During the Vibrant Goa Global Expo and Summit 2019 in October,
              DRDO signed technology transfer contracts with 16 Indian
              companies, including 3 startups, to produce products for the use
              by Indian Armed Forces.[18] This included high shelf life, high
              nutrition, ready-to-eat on-the-go food products to be consumed in
              the difficult terrain and bad weather.[18] DRDO and ISRO have
              agreed to collaborate in India's crewed orbital spacecraft project
              called Gaganyaan during which DRDOs various laboratories will
              tailor their defence capabilities to suit the needs of ISRO's
              human space mission with critical human-centric systems and
              technologies like space grade food, crew healthcare, radiation
              measurement and protection, parachutes for the safe recovery of
              the crew module and fire suppression system etc.
